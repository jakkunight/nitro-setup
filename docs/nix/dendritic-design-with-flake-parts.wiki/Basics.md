# Basics for usage of the Dendritic Pattern

This chapter offers a concise introduction to the
[Dendritic Pattern](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic) when employed in
conjunction with the [Flake Parts Framework](https://flake.parts).

The Dendritic Pattern facilitates a design approach that encapsulates features
and provides them to various recipients. It represents a fundamental shift in
thinking, akin to
[flipping the Configuration Matrix](https://not-a-number.io/2025/refactoring-my-infrastructure-as-code-configurations/#flipping-the-configuration-matrix).
Although this seemingly minor change may initially seem challenging to
comprehend, its significant positive impact becomes evident as soon as you
practically engage with the pattern and implement straightforward solutions to
your design challenges. A comprehensive summary of the pattern's extensive
advantages can be found in this excellent
[Dendritic Nix Summary by Vic](https://dendrix.denful.dev/Dendritic.html).

For general questions about the Dendritic Pattern, refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md)
section.

## Libraries

The **Dendritic Pattern**'s shift in mindset is independent of specific
frameworks and libraries. While other methods exist, the Flake Parts Framework
offers a highly recommended generic toolset that perfectly suits the purpose of
creating a Dendritic code structure.

We will extensively utilize one part of the Flake Parts Framework, the
[flake.modules option](https://flake.parts/options/flake-parts-modules.html), to
structure code into blocks, which will then be combined to form larger
components.

While other libraries are entirely optional, they can still be beneficial for
your setup. For more information on this, refer to the chapter titled
[The Flake Parts Framework](#the-flake-parts-framework).

## What is a _feature_ ?

In an informal sense, a feature provides essential content that can be utilized
in various configuration contexts.

Let's illustrate this with an example of how your typical configuration
hierarchy might transform: Instead of creating a host and assigning services,
applications, and user settings to this host, we now create a _feature_ that
will be used on hosts. Our perspective shifts from _top-down_ to _bottom-up_. A
_feature_ defines the attributes in the context of different areas, such as
NixOS, Nix-Darwin, or Home-Manager, and it encompasses everything that is
necessary. For instance, a _feature_ can include settings for various system
types, users, and services.

Our code will be transformed from

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["myHost1 (NixOS)"] -->|has system settings| B(services)
    A -->|has system settings| C(app installation)
    A -->|has user settings| D(home-manager)

    E["myHost2 (NixOS)"] -->|has system settings| F(services)
    E -->|has system settings| G(app installation)
    E -->|has user settings| H(home-manager)

    I["myHost3 (Nix-Darwin)"] -->|has system settings| J(services)
    I -->|has system settings| K(app installation)
    I -->|has user settings| L(home-manager)
```

to this

```mermaid
flowchart BT

    subgraph Nix-Darwin
        s1[settings] 
    end

    subgraph NixOS
        s2[settings] 
    end

    subgraph Home-Manager
        s3[settings] 
    end

    Nix-Darwin -->|part of| A(featureX)
    NixOS -->|part of| A
    Home-Manager -->|part of| A

    A -->|used on| B["myHost1 (NixOS)"]
    A -->|used on| C["myHost2 (NixOS)"]
    A -->|used on| D["myHost3 (Nix-Darwin)"]
    A -->|used as element of| E("featureY")
```

Why is this concept so different from your usual approach? All your
feature-related settings are consolidated, but still organized into separate
blocks for different contexts. This makes it easy to make code changes and fix
bugs. Managing side effects becomes much simpler. Adding new ideas to your
configuration is now a breeze when you understand how to use features for
specific purposes. This is the main focus of this guide (refer to chapter
[Design Patterns for Dendritic Aspects](Dendritic_Aspects.md#design-patterns-for-dendritic-aspects)).
Adding or removing a specific feature to something else (e.g., any of your
hosts, regardless of operating system type) often becomes a single line of code.
Adding new configuration contexts like Darwin is simply adding the missing
configuration to your feature in separate blocks without any code dependencies.

When defining _features_, you can customize the granularity and abstraction
level to suit your preferences.

Typical _feature_ abstractions are used for:

- Specific services or apps (e.g., “syncthing”, “firefox”)
- Service, settings or app categories (e.g., “mailServer”, "bluetooth",
  “codingApps”)
- Usage areas (e.g., “desktopEnvironment”)
- Specific users or hosts (e.g., “bob”, “myServer”)
- User or host categories (e.g., “adminUser”, “officeNotebook”)
- Nix tools (e.g., “impermanence”)

A _feature_ is an abstract thing, you define **what it is** (on a semantic
level) and **what it does** in different configuration contexts.

Every feature, by definition, is a **module** that has access to all attributes
in the highest-level configuration. This new concept may seem complicated at
first, but you'll soon understand why it's necessary for the pattern work and
why it's the key to many of its benefits.

## File Organization

File organization is not essential for the proper functioning of Nix when it is
syntactically correct, but it significantly aids in structuring your code for
easier management. Additionally, file naming is crucial for the semantic aspect
of the Dendritic Pattern, as it involves gluing together a feature by giving it
a name.

Here are some customizable file organization ideas:

- All features are organized in a "modules" folder, clearly indicating that each
  `.nix` file within is a feature module.
- Each feature must be named using its file or path name. If the code for a
  feature becomes too complex or extensive, it's advisable to split it into
  multiple files and place everything in a directory named after the feature.
  This practice, due to the value merging of all modules, makes file splitting
  very convenient. Utilize file splitting to enhance the structural clarity of
  your code.
- As the number of features grows, sub-directories can be used to provide
  additional structure, especially if a flat "modules" folder becomes confusing.
- External code (e.g., `hardware.nix`) should be extended with the appropriate
  Flake-Parts definition to integrate it into our feature module system, which
  is the preferred approach. Alternatively, it can be placed outside the central
  "modules" folder and included manually. For instance, when using custom
  packages in Flake-Part's `perSystem` with `pkgs.callPackage`.
- If a data file is exclusively used by a feature, it should be stored within
  that feature's directory. On the other hand, data used by multiple features
  can reside in a data directory located outside the feature directory. For
  instance, create a separate "secrets" directory that can be used by all
  features, in addition to the "modules" directory.
- When developing features, the location of the features directory or naming can
  change. Therefore, it's best practice to ensure that file references within a
  feature don't depend on its naming or the current directory location.
- File and directory names are arbitrary and irrelevant when using the feature
  code, but they hold significance for you and the overall pattern. Therefore,
  they can be considered documentation, so it's crucial to adhere to your naming
  convention.

## The Flake Parts Framework

The [Flake Parts Framework](https://flake.parts) serves as the foundation for
structuring code. While Flake Parts is a highly versatile tool, we only use a
few of its components, which are briefly outlined here to provide a starting
point.

When defining a feature, we frequently want to reuse it within our hierarchical
feature structure. To accomplish this, we define reusable modules by using the
Flake Parts `flake.modules` attribute to store our feature building blocks.

Creating such a reusable feature building block and storing it in
`flake.modules` looks like this:

```nix
flake.modules.<module class>.<aspect name> =
{
	imports = [ <list of other 'flake.modules' of same class> ];

    #
    # module code defining this `aspect`
    #
}
```

In most cases, the `aspect` name is the same as our feature name and can be used
interchangeably. However, there are exceptions to this rule. When a feature
contains multiple `aspect` definitions, I'll comment on that later.

Every `flake.modules` definition has a configuration context, known as the
`<module class>`, which serves as the code's reference point. The most commonly
used module classes are `nixos`, `darwin`, and `homeManager`, and these are also
demonstrated in the examples. Of course, the same principle applies if you use
other class types, such as `nixOnDroid` or `nixvim`.

`flake.modules.<module class>.<aspect>`s and features are structurally related
in the following way:

- One feature can define multiple `aspects`, especially for different module
  classes.
- `aspects` can be nested hierarchically using `imports`, which allows us to
  nest features. The use of module `imports` also changes how we enable
  something: instead of using `enable = true;`, we simply import the module. The
  code within the module enables the service, etc., by default.
- A feature is sometimes more than a collection of `aspect` definitions: besides
  defining the structured module hierarchy, a feature sometimes defines or
  accesses other flake-parts attributes. Let's call these parts flake-parts
  boilerplate.
- All features are imported by default. This means all `aspects` are defined and
  all flake-part boilerplates are active. However, be aware that an `aspect`
  definition is just that, a definition for our module library, so it remains
  inactive until it is used in some flake-parts boilerplate to be accessible at
  the flake outputs.

Let's examine how this appears in the code of a feature:

```nix
{ # <- this is the feature module

  # 'flake.modules' module definition
  flake.modules.nixos.aspect1 = {
    
    # defining the hierarchical module structure
    imports = with inputs.self.modules.nixos; [
      aspect2
      aspect3
    ];

  };

  # using the previously defined 'aspect1' module for a system configuration (flake-part boilerplate)
  flake.nixosConfigurations = ... # nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem using inputs.self.modules.nixos.aspect1;

}
```

> - `Aspect` modules are modules of a specific configuration context

> [!WARNING]
> When importing `aspect` modules within other `aspect` modules to establish a

>   module class. An example is a `flake.modules.generic.nix-settings` module,
>   which can be used in both NixOS and Darwin contexts.
> - Imports **must not** be made conditionally (e.g., using `lib.mkIf`). This is
>   a standard Nix restriction because Nix encounters issues evaluating

> - Avoid importing modules multiple times, as this can lead to unwanted side
>   effects. Define your logical structure in a way that ensures modules are

>   locations within the same path.

By default, all feature modules are imported at the `flake.nix` file. Instead of
manually importing each file, the collection folder "modules" (the home of all
our features) becomes convenient. We simply need to import all `.nix` files from
this folder recursively. Therefore, it's essential that all the files in the
folder are feature modules.

The import is accomplished with a few lines of Nix code. Alternatively, you can
use the [vic/import-tree](https://github.com/vic/import-tree) tool, which, as a
bonus, also excludes all files and folders with a name prefix of "`_`" from the
import. This can be particularly useful for disabling unfinished code or code
that is not a `<flake class>` (feature) module.

The import of all feature modules can be accomplished as follows:

```nix
outputs = inputs: inputs.flake-parts.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } (inputs.import-tree ./modules);
```

Another useful tool from the same author takes it a step further by embedding
the content of the `flake.nix` file directly into the code. While the use of
[vic/flake-file](https://github.com/vic/flake-file) is optional, it provides the
advantage of incorporating the changes to your `flake.nix` required by a feature
into the local code of that feature. Consequently, the `flake.nix` file will be
automatically generated, eliminating the need for manual editing. This approach
aligns perfectly with the concept that all relevant information about a feature
is defined within it. However, it's important to regenerate the `flake.nix` file
using the command `nix run .#write-flake` every time you add new flake inputs to
a feature.

> [!NOTE]
> [vic/import-tree](https://github.com/vic/import-tree) and
> [vic/flake-file](https://github.com/vic/flake-file) will be used in the
> example code snippets.

> [!TIP]
> With the flake-file tool, you no longer have to edit the `flake.nix` file
> manually. However, there's an exception: if you accidentally create a faulty
> `flake.nix` file, such as by making a typo in an input URL, the new flake.nix
> generation will fail. To resolve this issue, you need to fix the error in the
> `flake.nix` file, not just the `flake-file` setting. Once you make the
> necessary changes, the `flake.nix` file will be generated successfully.

Flake-Parts and, if necessary, other Nix tool libraries must be set up. Here's
an example of how it looks:

```nix
  flake-file.inputs = {
    flake-parts.url = "github:hercules-ci/flake-parts";
    flake-file.url = "github:vic/flake-file";
    import-tree.url = "github:vic/import-tree";
  };

  imports = [
    inputs.flake-parts.flakeModules.modules
    inputs.flake-file.flakeModules.default
  ];

  systems = [
    "aarch64-darwin"
    "aarch64-linux"
    "x86_64-darwin"
    "x86_64-linux"
  ];
```

> [!TIP]
> The
> [flake-file](https://github.com/vic/flake-file?tab=readme-ov-file#flakemodulesdendritic)
> tool has also a `flakeModule.dendritic` module included, which conveniently
> sets up flake-file, import-tree, flake-parts and sets `outputs` to import all
> `./modules`.

When creating configurations (in our boilerplate parts), we need a few lines of
code that we can store in a personal library for convenience. For instance, for
nixosConfigurations, we can create something like this:

```nix
mkNixos = system: name: {
  ${name} = inputs.nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
    modules = [
      inputs.self.modules.nixos.${name}
      { nixpkgs.hostPlatform = lib.mkDefault system; }
    ];
  };
};
```

Now, we have all the necessary components ready to construct our configurations
out of features using `aspect` modules as the building blocks.
