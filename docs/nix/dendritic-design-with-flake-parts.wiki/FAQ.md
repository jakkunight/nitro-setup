## What is it? Why should I care?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dendritic Pattern is a software design pattern.**

**Quote from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)**

> A software design pattern describes a reusable solution to a commonly needed
> behavior in software. A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be copied
> directly into source code. Rather, it is a description of and a template for
> solving a particular type of problem that can be used in many different
> contexts, including different programming languages and computing platforms.
> Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer

In essence, it defines a _way of doing_ things. It is not a Nix library nor a
framework.

The pattern contains two main principles:

- Top-level modules: Everything is constructed using a single type of modules,
  the top-level modules, which then define lower-level modules.
- Features: Code is bundled into features, which serve as the building blocks
  for structuring the code.

It's perfectly acceptable if you don't grasp the meaning of this immediately. A
more detailed explanation is necessary (see the [guide](Home.md#contents)).
However, once you comprehend these two principles, the application of the
pattern in your code becomes effortless. It's simply that you approach things
differently now.

You could describe the change as introducing a new programming paradigm, similar
to introducing something like object orientation in other programming languages.
To clarify, Dendritic Pattern is _**NOT**_ object orientation for Nix (although
some aspects may seem similar), but you can compare the outcomes: can you
achieve the same results without it? Yes, you can. Does it alter your coding
approach, and do you gain certain advantages for specific scenarios? Yes, you
will.

The Dendritic Pattern's strength lies in its use of very simple and generic
rules that yield several significant benefits when adhered to. These benefits
are implicit and naturally arise from using the pattern; you don't have to take
any additional actions. Utilizing the pattern simplifies many design challenges
that you may have encountered before.

While you may need to invest time initially (for learning new concepts and
refactoring your existing code), the long-term benefits will, in most cases,
outweigh the effort.

## What are the advantages/drawbacks?

When you design your code based on the Dendritic Pattern, you'll enjoy several
key advantages, in no particular order:

- **Multi-platform Support:**
  - Code for multiple platforms is grouped together and coexists within a single
    file.
  - All platforms share the same code structure, making it easier to develop for
    different platforms.
  - Using code for different platforms becomes magically effortless, you just
    use the feature.
- **Simplified Structural Design:**
  - Everything is a self-contained building block, a feature. This coherent
    system for structuring your code based on these building blocks simplifies
    the design process.
  - The Dendritic Pattern helps you create a clean and simple code structure,
    addressing the question "Where to place this configuration?".
- **Reduced Dependencies:**
  - Adding or removing things is equivalent to adding or removing features.
  - This minimal dependency structure makes code management easier.
- **Decreased Effort:**
  - The amount of glue code is reduced, and you have to create fewer options.
    Enabling is often replaced by imports, making the code more concise.
- **Enhanced Reusability:**
  - Features consolidate everything in one place, simplifying code reuse in
    other projects.
  - Standardization allows for easier code exchange, and files become
    self-documenting for those familiar with the conventions.
- **Improved Bug Fixing:**
  - The Dendritic Pattern enforces consolidation, eliminating the search in
    scattered code pieces that may break.
- **Freedom of File (Re-)Organization:**
  - Changing file names or paths doesn't break the code.
  - Automatic importing eliminates the need for complex relative input paths in
    `default.nix` files.
- **Integrated Communication Between Configuration Classes:**
  - Workaround constructs like `specialArgs` become unnecessary.
  - You can bridge the gap between different configuration classes naturally
    with `let ... in`or higher level options.
- **Consistent Semantic Meaning:**
  - Every `.nix` file has the same module type and belongs to a feature. This
    eliminates file type confusion between NixOS module files and Home-Manager
    module files.
- **Decluttered `flake.nix`:**
  - The primary task of `flake.nix` is reduced to defining inputs.
  - Relevant code blocks are now in their appropriate locations, not in a overly
    complex `flake.nix`.

It may seem like an exaggeration to claim that two simple design principles will
have such a significant impact, but you'll likely experience awe-inspiring
moments yourself when you begin working with the pattern.

Of course, Dendritic Design isn't the sole method for designing your code. Other
patterns and solutions for single problems exist. Therefore, you may have
already achieved a subset (or all) of the advantages mentioned above in your
existing setup using your own solutions. The Dendritic Pattern stands out
because it is simple yet incredibly powerful.

If you like to look into more (technical) details about the advantages, you can
use this
[Dendritic Nix Summary by Vic](https://dendrix.denful.dev/Dendritic.html).

Using the Dendritic Design comes with a drawback: to use it conveniently, you
typically rely on an external library that provides basic functionality for
handling the abstraction part with "top-level modules".

The dependency on that specific tool has several implications:

- Reuse is now limited to that particular ecosystem of this tool.
- There's a risk of the tool development being canceled.
- If you want to use code that wasn't created for this ecosystem, you have to
  integrate it first.

These are valid points and should play a significant role in selecting the right
framework to use. This is not only a decision you have to make when starting to
use the Dendritic Design but **every time** you decide to use any library or
tool, and is applicable for tools like Home-Manager etc.

It's always a trade-off between the benefits gained and the potential drawbacks.
This guide focuses on using the Dendritic Pattern with the flake-parts
framework, which minimizes these drawbacks. See the chapter
[Should I use Flake-Parts and what are the alternatives?](#should-i-use-flake-parts-and-what-are-the-alternatives)
for the reasons behind its selection.

## Why is the definition of the Dendritic Pattern so complicated? What if I don't understand everything?

The Dendritic Pattern is intentionally very generic. It defines a design pattern
on a very abstract level, making it independent of the tools / frameworks used
and the specific area of application (e.g., flake, non-flake).

This universal nature comes with a trade-off: you need to use very precise
language and specialized terms that are only understandable by experts. It's
similar to reading a legal text: it's written in your mother tongue, but you may
not understand anything at all or even worse, you may misunderstand it. You need
law training (like a lawyer) to read such texts, or you need a how-to
translation for specific cases made for non-experts.

The positive news is that you don't have to understand all the abstract details
of the Dendritic Pattern, such as the
[`deferredModule` type](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-option-types-submodule),
if you just want to "drive the car" instead of "engineering it".

If you start using the Dendritic Pattern with Flake-Parts, you need minimal
background knowledge. Of course, tools like Flake-Parts can do so much more cool
things that you couldn't do without, but this will be an optional feature. You
don't have to cover that from the start; use the introduction in the guide
first.

## Is Flake-Parts the Dendritic Pattern? Why use two names?

The pattern itself is generic and doesn't depend on a specific tool or
framework.

Flake-Parts is a framework that can be used to easily implement the design
principles of the Dendritic Pattern for flakes. The confusion between
Flake-Parts and the Dendritic Pattern arises because Flake-Parts is widely used
in repositories based on the Dendritic Pattern, and many examples explain it
using this framework.

## Should I start my config design with the Dendritic Pattern? Is a migration worth it?

To answer these questions, it's best to consider different scenarios.

1. If you're a complete beginner and just started with Nix, you should take your
   first steps without following a pattern. Patterns address problems you won't
   encounter at the beginning of your journey. However, if you gain more
   experience and encounter issues with a more complex setup, you should
   reevaluate your approach.
2. If you're an experienced user and starting a new configuration from scratch,
   there are very few arguments against using the Dendritic Design from the
   start. However, you can also use a specific configuration tool that you're
   **very confident** will meet your needs and skip the Dendritic Design.
3. If you're an experienced user with a complex and unstable setup, you've
   likely navigated yourself through many redesigns to a point where code
   changes become increasingly time-consuming, and structural changes would
   require a redesign anyway. In this situation, the Dendritic Pattern is a
   no-brainer. In most cases, it will be the silver bullet you've been searching
   for.
4. If you're a very experienced user with a complex and stable setup, you may
   have already addressed many of the advantages of the Dendritic Design with
   your elaborate setup. This is especially true if you're an intensive user of
   flake-parts and have other design principles like "roles" in place. Going
   "all-in" and converting everything to top-level modules and features may be
   worth the effort to consistently reap the benefits. However, this is a
   trade-off. If you're happy with your current setup, there's nothing wrong
   with sticking with it. Keep the Dendritic Design in your drawer for a rainy
   day when you can test it out and see if it can solve your problem.

## Is it only useful for cross-platform development, or is there more to it?

The Dendritic Design offers numerous advantages when implemented. The impact of
these benefits can vary depending on the specific use case.

It excels in multi-platform environments, particularly when combining two or
more of NixOS, Nix-Darwin, Home-Manager for systems, or Home-Manager standalone.
This is often the point where complexity increases significantly, making the
current code base difficult to manage, debug, or extend.

However, the Dendritic Design can also be beneficial in other use cases, such as
gaming setups and desktop ricing. While it may not provide specific advantages
for configuring these areas, it helps modularize code for better combination,
reuse, and exchange with others working on the same configuration. For example,
the Dendrix community-driven distribution of Dendritic Nix configurations,
available on this site from
@vic [Dendrix - community-driven distribution of Dendritic Nix configurations.](https://dendrix.oeiuwq.com/),
offers a collection of shared Dendritic code and more information on this topic.
Of course, the shared code is limited to the specific ecosystem used (in this
case, flake-parts). It's also worth noting that the `flake.nix` file is no
longer the best place to find an overview of a project's outputs; see the
chapter for more information.

Many of the benefits of the Dendritic Design are use-case independent. For
instance, it leads to a clutter-free flake.nix file, simplifies file
(re-)organization, and enhances code modularity. These advantages might be
enough to consider adopting the Dendritic Design pattern, particularly when
starting a configuration from scratch.

## Dendritic Pattern seems just like a "buzzword", why is this different from what I'm already doing for the configuration of my hosts?

If you merely glance at the headlines and spot words like "modules" and
"features", it might initially appear that Dendritic is merely a buzzword for
something trivial, something you're already doing.

However, this couldn't be further from the truth:

- The term "feature" carries a specific meaning, which is likely quite different
  from your interpretation. In this context, "feature" refers to a novel design
  concept. If the term had been chosen differently, such as "Dendritic Pattern
  Building Block," you might not have drawn incorrect conclusions. However,
  "feature" is undeniably more catchy. Just remember that it's more than just a
  word.
- Using "top-level" modules for everything is not the standard approach of
  simply placing modules in separate files. While you may already be using
  modules for everything, you may not have the additional abstraction level in
  your modules that is essential for the Dendritic Pattern.

## How does it compare to other template repositories / host management tools?

The Dendritic Pattern is not a template or a code toolset. It offers a "how-to"
for your design, but not more, not less.

This "how-to" is quite simple to use, yet incredibly powerful. It renders many
template repositories and host management tools obsolete because you can now
effortlessly create similar things yourself, which you may not have been able to
design before. Of course, practice is necessary, but the basics are
straightforward, and the complexity of your setup can grow with your experience
without necessitating a redesign!

## I already use modules, why should I put an abstraction layer on top?

Using top-level modules is a key factor in the advantages of the Dendritic
Pattern. Initially, the concept may appear artificial, but it presents numerous
possibilities that were previously unavailable. Once you comprehend the concept,
there's no additional coding effort required when utilizing this technique; you
simply reap the benefits.

## Should I use Flake-Parts and what are the alternatives?

When implementing the Dendritic Pattern, you must first meet a technical
prerequisite: standardize all your different module classes and embed them into
"top-level"-modules.

Many people, rightly so, are cautious when they have to change their coding
library setup. However, if you want to use Dendritic Design, you must implement
some basic functionality, and there are several approaches to consider.

- Create your own implementation of some helper functions that accomplish the
  task.
  - Pros: No dependencies, total freedom.
  - Cons: Not for beginners, and you create an "island" because your code will
    only work with your library.

- Use an established library or framework that offers the needed functionality.
  - Pros: Convenient and easy, and you have a large user base with other
    configurations to share with.
  - Cons: You add a dependency, your code only works in this "ecosystem".

- Wait until the needed functionality is part of standard NixOS options and its
  lib.
  - Pros: Standardized, maximum portable code, and no dependency.
  - Cons: You cannot start before this becomes available (if ever).

At the moment, Flake-Parts is probably the most widely used tool or framework
for generating a Dendritic setup. Especially as a beginner, it's a safe choice.
Most examples and reference repositories are based on it. It has a large user
base; a current search on GitHub showed over 14,000 `flakes.nix` files using it.
Even if the specific implementation doesn't rely on a Dendritic Design, the
modules operate within the same ecosystem and can be reused or serve as
inspiration. The flake-parts framework is intentionally designed to be extremely
lightweight, minimizing the risk of introducing additional dependencies. Of
course, you can extend its functionality by incorporating additional libraries,
but this is entirely optional.

If you're looking for a non-flake toolset, you should definitely check out
[vic/dendritic-unflake](https://github.com/vic/dendritic-unflake).

There are also tools available that offer a Dendritic Design with additional
helper functions and concepts to simplify your workflow. These tools often use
flake-parts under the hood.

Some examples:

- [den - an aspect-oriented approach to Dendritic Nix configurations](https://github.com/vic/den)
- [Unify - A framework for unifying multiple types of Nix configurations, allowing you to easily define them in the same modules](https://codeberg.org/quasigod/unify/)

## Is it mandatory for me to learn all the `Aspect` patterns mentioned in the guide?

The `Aspect` patterns provided in the guide are meant to inspire you and serve
as a template for similar situations.

Of course, they are not mandatory in any way to utilize the Dendritic Pattern.

## Why is the `flake.nix` so empty?

One of the primary advantages of the Dendritic Design with flake-parts is the
decluttering of the `flake.nix` file. Logic code and outputs are moved into
modules, leaving the `flake.nix` file with its core functionality.

The `flake.nix` file is reduced to its essential features, as outlined in the
[Wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes):

> Nix flakes [...] provide a consistent structure for Nix projects, enable
> pinning specific versions of each dependency, and facilitate sharing these
> dependencies through lock files. Overall, they enhance the convenience of
> writing reproducible Nix expressions.

Moving output definitions out of the `flake.nix` file and into a module also
means that you won't get an overview of the code by simply looking at the
`flake.nix` file anymore. If you intend to share your code, it's crucial to make
sure that users are aware of the location of the reusable outputs. In such
cases, file name conventions, especially those that use semantic directory
structures as documentation, become even more important.
