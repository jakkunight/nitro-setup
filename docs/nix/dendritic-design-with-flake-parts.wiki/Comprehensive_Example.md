# Comprehensive Example

The power of the new structure with the **Dendritic Pattern** becomes evident
when you consider how simplified many aspects of the configuration and code
maintenance have become. Here's the source of a
[comprehensive example](https://github.com/Doc-Steve/dendritic-design-with-flake-parts/tree/main)
to demonstrate all previous concepts in a real-world usage for you to explore.

The comprehensive example has this structure:

```

Let's have a look at some details:

- The File Naming Conventions - you may have noticed that some directories have
  brackets. These brackets serve two purposes:
  1. They indicate that a directory is the name of a feature, not just for
     organizational purposes. All feature `.nix` files are always located in a
     directory named after the feature.
  2. In the brackets, the usage contexts of the feature are listed, categorized
     by letter: (N)ixOS and/or (D)arwin. Small caps indicate usage in the
     Home-Manager context. Since not every Home-Manager Configuration works on
     both systems, "n" and "d" refer to usage for Home-Manager on the specific
     system.
- You'll only find a small, unrealistic number of features, such as for
  services, system settings, programs, and so on. Modules often simply import
  other modules and set a few or no attributes for configuration. This is
  intentional: more features that repeat the same structure wouldn't add any new
  information to this example. A wall of attributes would also make it difficult
  to explore the structural design variations. I leave the possibility of
  additional features and attributes to your imagination.
- Separation of features into several files is used intensively. Flake-parts
  boilerplate of each feature is put in separate files (named `flake-parts.nix`)
  in the feature directories, with file separation based on system context
  (`nixos.nix`, `darwin.nix`), and separation for complexity reasons. An extreme
  example is `homeserver`. The whole directory structure is one feature. You
  could place the entire feature into a single file, but separating the code
  into files, even with sub-directories, significantly simplifies code
  maintenance and becomes essential for a home server (keep in mind that this is
  just an excerpt). Although the sub-directories themselves are not features,
  they are organized with similar names, making it easy to locate where the
  corresponding features are utilized and configured.
- Features are grouped into obvious directories such as `users`, `hosts`,
  `services`, and `system/settings` for better organization. Keep in mind that
  this grouping is merely an example and does not affect the functionality of
  the features. You can also add other directories and create sub-structures for
  specific categories like `gaming`, `desktop-managers`, and so on.
- To navigate and manipulate features as desired, relative paths are employed.
  For instance, refer to the example `nix/tools/secrets`.
- The `system/system types` directory contains features for defining the basic
  environment, which will be used for all hosts and users. It's a best practice
  to have some kind of `default` feature. In such a feature, you typically set
  very low-level system defaults and ensure that all widely used Nix tools in
  your setup (e.g., home-manager, impermanence, homebrew) are configured. I went
  overboard and created different system types, creating a hierarchy to define
  first the bare minimum settings, then the default with essential Nix tools,
  then CLI settings, and finally desktop settings. This is an example of using
  inheritance. It's utilized for hosts and users (e.g., `eve` is a system-cli
  only user!) that use different system types.
- An example of Nix code we want to store outside of our `modules` system can be
  found in the `packages` directory, which is utilized by the `pkgs-by-name`
  tool to demonstrate a local package `cowsay`.
- Creating a new host or user just requires only a few lines of code. The
  modules automatically match and work as intended across all environments. No
  extra effort is required to select the necessary code from the comprehensive
  feature library. See usage of the same feature 'bob' in the `linux-desktop`
  and on the `macbook`.
- The user `bob` is created using the `user factory aspect function`, which is
  located in the `factory` directory. Additionally, `bob` utilizes a
  `factory aspect` to link his `cifs-share` at `linux-desktop`. The
  `factory aspect function` files are accompanied by documentation in their
  names, which also provides information about the `<classes>` of the aspects
  they are used for.
- The `homeserver` utilizes the `DRY aspects` for its network interface in
  `network.nix`, which are defined in `system/network`.
- Integrating a new Nix library becomes a breeze, as demonstrated in the
  `nix/tools` examples. Generate the feature, define all necessary parameters,
  and seamlessly insert it into the default classes. This approach eliminates
  the need for modifications to an increasingly complex and fragile `flake.nix`
  and other module files. Our `flake.nix` is automatically generated from our
  features and primarily consists of input definitions and a single line to
  import all feature modules.
- Sometimes, special effort is needed for Nix tools that are only compatible
  with a specific environment, like the `Impermanence` tool, which is only
  available on NixOS. Since Impermanence options are utilized in the code of
  numerous Home-Manager modules, and we intend to reuse the same code for
  Darwin, we must exercise additional caution before accessing any Impermanence
  options.
- All related components are now conveniently located in the feature's
  directory, such as `programs/gnome`. This feature concept simplifies debugging
  and maintaining code consistency significantly. Each feature directory
  contains all the necessary definitions and settings related to that feature.
- Features can be used on both Linux and MacOS, facilitating code sharing. For
  instance, `basicPackages` is shared between the two platforms. This separation
  is achieved through separate modules, eliminating the need for intricate
  conditional logic. The usage remains simple, as importing the feature
  automatically selects the appropriate code.
- Although this example showcases a sophisticated directory structure, there's
  no risk of import errors during refactoring. By employing the Dendritic
  Pattern, we eliminate the need for manual maintenance of numerous scattered
  `default.nix` files with lengthy relative file paths.
- The directory `nix/flake-parts` contains a special feature. This feature
  includes the setup of the Flake Parts Framework, which includes tools that
  will be used for our Dendritic setup. Additionally, it contains a convenience
  library that allows you to create the flake output for NixOS, Darwin, and
  Home-Manager configurations plus the `<factory function>` library.

Now, it's your turn to try it out. Enjoy exploring the Dendritic Pattern!
